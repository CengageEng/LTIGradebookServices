This folder is not a MOODLE folder.

It just contains scripts to test externally the Gradebookservices API and it should not be inside your moodle code. 

If you are viewing this from inside your moodle code, then you can delete the full scripts folder

This folder should be removed when creating the zip to install the plugin
